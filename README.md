This is developed to showcase the basic workflow of a datascience project. 
In this, the dataset consisting of data related to seismic activity of various provinces of USA with history of high seismic activity are present with columns such as lattitude, longitude, time of occurance, date of occurance, Depth of place, and magnitude(in richter scale). The idea is to predict the magnitude when all other aforementioned fields are provided to the model.
The exploration has been carried out using three classical machine learning algorithms and at the end performance of each is evaluated based on R^2 metric and accuracy score.
The plots are generated to provide better insights towards data and prediction of the model which are present in the 'plots' folder.
